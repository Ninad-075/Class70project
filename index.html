                <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">One of the oldest Monastery in Darjeeling. It is situated in peaceful and beautiful landscape just 15 minutes walk from Ghoom Railway Station. We can see religious God and Goddess paintings believed by Buddhism inside which can give spiritual power to one who prays there with clean heart. From the compound of Monastery on a clear day one can have a scenery of hills all around which is great for nature lovers.</p>

                <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Demand for renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, smart grids, and electric vehicles has surged. Wind and solar generation accounted for one-tenth of global energy production in the first half of 2020. More businesses, cities and countries have pledged to meet 100% of their energy needs through renewable energy. Improvements in technologies such as global power grids and energy storage systems, and more efficient devices and vehicles make these ambitious goals increasingly attainable. Renewable energy, primarily wind and solar, is poised to overtake coal as the top global power producer of energy in the next five years.

                    As interest in renewable energy rose, demand for fossil fuels fell. After 92 years, ExxonMobil has lost its place on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Pledges to ban sales of new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars over the next 10 to 15 years have been made by governments from California to the U.K. Global fossil fuel companies found it more difficult to get financing for projects as financial institutions came under pressure for their role in driving deforestation, fires and biodiversity loss.

                    The incoming administration of U.S. president-elect Joe Biden is predicted to be a boon to renewable energy, and to increase pressure on coal. A stricter environmental regulatory landscape under Biden, as well as increased climate action, are predicted to impact global power markets.</p>

                <h4>China emits more greenhouse gases than all developed countries combined</h4>
                <img src="Emissions-Factory-Smog-Pollution.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A report has found that China emitted more greenhouse gases than the U.S. and other developed countries combined in 2019. The May 6 report by New York-based research firm Rhodium Group found that China produced more than two times the amount of the U.S.’s total emissions. Projects under the Chinese regime’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) contributed to its excessive emissions levels.

                    According to the Rhodium Group report, China accounted for more than 27 percent of total global emissions. This was more than twice the amount coming from the U.S., which followed at 11 percent. India placed third with 6.6 percent of emissions, while the entire European Union accounted for 6.4 percent.

                    The report also noted that China emitted almost 14.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2019. The amount was more than triple the emission levels of 1990 and a 25 percent increase over the past decade. China’s per capita emission reached 10.1 tons in 2019 – constituting an almost three-fold increase over the past two decades.

                    “While final global data for 2020 is not yet available, we expect China’s per capita emissions exceeded the [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] average in 2020,” the report remarked. It also pointed out that as China’s net greenhouse gas emissions rose around 1.7 percent, those of other nations declined sharply amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    Sen. Rick Scott responded to the Rhodium Group’s findings through a tweet. “Communist China is the world’s worst polluter and we can’t trust it will do anything to change course,” he wrote.

                    The lawmaker also warned against working with China toward climate change. Scott continued: “Addressing our changing climate requires real solutions, but we can’t pretend toothless agreements with mega-polluters like Communist China will do anything to advance that work.”

                    According to the nonprofit group Global Energy Monitor, China had 1,082 coal-fired power plants in service as of January 2021. The communist country is also building 92 more power plants as of writing. An additional 135 coal-fired plants are also in the pre-construction phase. These figures only cement China’s position as the world’s largest coal producer and user. (Related: NASA images reveal massive DROP in pollution in China following coronavirus outbreak.)</p>
